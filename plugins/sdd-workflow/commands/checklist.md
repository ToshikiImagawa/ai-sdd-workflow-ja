# Checklist - Quality Checklist Generation

Automatically generates comprehensive quality assurance checklists from specifications, design documents, and task
breakdowns.

## Prerequisites

**Before execution, you must read `sdd-workflow:sdd-workflow` agent content to understand AI-SDD principles.**

This command follows the sdd-workflow agent principles for quality assurance.

### Directory Path Resolution

**Use `SDD_*` environment variables to resolve directory paths.**

| Environment Variable     | Default Value        | Description                    |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `SDD_ROOT`               | `.sdd`               | Root directory                 |
| `SDD_REQUIREMENT_PATH`   | `.sdd/requirement`   | PRD/Requirements directory     |
| `SDD_SPECIFICATION_PATH` | `.sdd/specification` | Specification/Design directory |
| `SDD_TASK_PATH`          | `.sdd/task`          | Task log directory             |

**Path Resolution Priority:**

1. Use `SDD_*` environment variables if set
2. Check `.sdd-config.json` if environment variables are not set
3. Use default values if neither exists

The following documentation uses default values, but replace with custom values if environment variables or
configuration file exists.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

### Input Format

```
/checklist {feature-name} {ticket-number}
/checklist {feature-name}  # Uses feature-name as ticket directory
```

### Input Examples

```
/checklist user-auth TICKET-123
/checklist task-management
/checklist auth/user-login TICKET-789  # For hierarchical structure
```

## Processing Flow

### 1. Load Source Documents

Both flat and hierarchical structures are supported.

**For flat structure**:

```
Load .sdd/requirement/{feature-name}.md (PRD, if exists)
Load .sdd/specification/{feature-name}_spec.md (required)
Load .sdd/specification/{feature-name}_design.md (required)
Load .sdd/task/{ticket}/tasks.md (if exists)
```

**For hierarchical structure** (when argument contains `/`):

```
Load .sdd/requirement/{parent-feature}/index.md (parent feature PRD, if exists)
Load .sdd/requirement/{parent-feature}/{feature-name}.md (child feature PRD, if exists)
Load .sdd/specification/{parent-feature}/index_spec.md (parent feature spec, if exists)
Load .sdd/specification/{parent-feature}/{feature-name}_spec.md (child feature spec, required)
Load .sdd/specification/{parent-feature}/index_design.md (parent feature design, if exists)
Load .sdd/specification/{parent-feature}/{feature-name}_design.md (child feature design, required)
Load .sdd/task/{ticket}/tasks.md (if exists)
```

**⚠️ Note the difference in naming conventions**:

- **Under requirement**: No suffix (`index.md`, `{feature-name}.md`)
- **Under specification**: `_spec` or `_design` suffix required (`index_spec.md`, `{feature-name}_spec.md`)

### 2. Extract Verification Points

From each document, extract checkable items:

**From PRD** (if exists):

| Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-xxx) | Verify quality attributes   |
| Acceptance Criteria                   | Verify business value       |
