# Generate PRD - Requirements Specification Generation

Generates PRD (Requirements Specification) from input business requirements according to the AI-SDD workflow.

## Prerequisites

**Before execution, you must read `sdd-workflow:sdd-workflow` agent content to understand AI-SDD principles.**

This command follows the sdd-workflow agent principles for PRD generation.

### Skills Used

This command uses the following skills:

| Skill                        | Purpose                                                               |
|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sdd-workflow:sdd-templates` | Generate `.docs/PRD_TEMPLATE.md` when project template does not exist |

**Template Preparation Flow**:

1. Use `.docs/PRD_TEMPLATE.md` (project template) if it exists
2. If not, use `sdd-templates` skill to generate the template

### PRD / Requirements Diagram Positioning (Reference)

**Abstraction Level: Highest** | **Focus: What to build, why to build it**

| Item                  | Details                                                                                                      |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Define high-level product requirements (business value)                                                      |
| **Content**           | User requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements in SysML requirements diagram format |
| **Technical Details** | **Not included**                                                                                             |
| **SysML Elements**    | Requirements Diagram (req)                                                                                   |

### Document Dependencies

```
PRD (Requirements Diagram) ← *_spec.md ← *_design.md ← Implementation
```

PRD is the most upstream document and serves as the foundation for subsequent specifications and design documents.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

### Input Examples

```
/generate_prd A feature for users to manage tasks.
Available only to logged-in users.
Supports task creation, editing, deletion, and completion, with due date and priority settings.
Sends email notifications for tasks nearing their due date.
```

## Generation Rules

### 1. Vibe Coding Risk Assessment (Perform First)

Analyze input content and assess risk based on the following criteria:

| Risk   | Condition                   | Response                                         |
|:-------|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| High   | Business requirements vague | Confirm missing info with user before generating |
| Medium | Some requirements unclear   | Clarify ambiguous points before generating       |
| Low    | Requirements clear          | Can generate as-is                               |

**Examples of Vague Input**:

- "Add a useful feature" → Confirm specific functionality
- "Improve user experience" → Confirm improvement target and goals
- "Same feature as competitors" → Confirm specific feature specifications

### 2. Input Content Analysis

Extract/infer the following from input:

| Extraction Item                 | Description                                | Required |
|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:---------|
| **Feature Name**                | Identifier used for filename               | Yes      |
| **Background/Purpose**          | Why this feature is needed, business value | Yes      |
| **User Requirements**           | What end users want                        | Yes      |
| **Functional Requirements**     | Functions the system should provide        | Yes      |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | Performance, security, availability, etc.  |          |
| **Constraints**                 | Technical/business constraints             |          |
| **Preconditions**               | Assumptions for feature operation          |          |

### 3. Missing Information Confirmation

If important items cannot be determined from input, **confirm with user before generation**:

- Feature name unclear
- Business value/purpose unclear
- User requirements subject (who will use it) unclear
- Success criteria/goals unclear

### 4. Existing Document Check

Check the following before generation:

```
Does .docs/requirement-diagram/{feature-name}.md already exist? (PRD)
Does .docs/specification/{feature-name}_spec.md already exist? (spec)
Does .docs/specification/{feature-name}_design.md already exist? (design)
```

**If PRD exists**: Confirm with user whether to overwrite.

**If spec/design exists**:

- After PRD generation, verify no impact on consistency with existing spec/design
- If requirement IDs are added/changed, notify that spec/design may need updates

## Output Format

### Template Preparation

Follow these steps to prepare the template:

1. Check if `.docs/PRD_TEMPLATE.md` exists
2. **If exists**: Use that template
3. **If not exists**: Use `sdd-workflow:sdd-templates` skill to generate `.docs/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`, then use the generated
   template

### Template Application Notes

- Replace template placeholders (`{Feature Name}`, `{Requirement Name}`, etc.) based on input content
- Sections with `<MUST>` markers are required, `<RECOMMENDED>` are recommended, `<OPTIONAL>` are optional
- Use SysML requirementDiagram syntax for requirements diagrams
- Manage requirement IDs (UR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx) uniquely

**Save Location**: `.docs/requirement-diagram/{feature-name}.md`

## Generation Flow

```

1. Analyze input content
   ↓
2. Vibe Coding risk assessment
   ├─ High: Confirm missing info with user → Resume after response
   ├─ Medium: Confirm ambiguous points → Resume after response
   └─ Low: Proceed to next step
   ↓
3. Check existing documents
   ├─ If PRD exists: Confirm overwrite
   └─ If spec/design exists: Understand impact scope
   ↓
4. Generate and save PRD
   ↓
5. Check consistency with existing spec/design (if they exist)
   ├─ Consistent: Proceed to next step
   └─ Updates needed: Notify recommendation to update spec/design
   ↓
6. Propose next steps
    - Create abstract specification with /generate_spec
    - If existing spec exists, recommend update

```

## Consistency Check with Existing spec/design

If existing spec/design exists, verify the following after PRD generation:

### Check Items

| Check Item                     | Verification Content                                        |
|:-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New Requirement Addition**   | Are requirements added in PRD reflected in spec?            |
| **Requirement Changes**        | Are requirements changed in PRD reflected in spec/design?   |
| **Requirement Deletion**       | Are requirements deleted from PRD removed from spec/design? |
| **Requirement ID Consistency** | Do requirement ID references in spec match PRD?             |

### Handling When Updates Needed

1. **Spec needs update**: Regenerate with `/generate_spec` or update manually
2. **Design needs update**: Check if spec changes require design decision revision
3. **Impact Scope Notification**: Clearly indicate to user which documents need updates

## Post-Generation Actions

1. **Save File**:
    - `.docs/requirement-diagram/{feature-name}.md`

2. **Consistency Check**:
    - If existing spec/design exists: Verify impact and notify if updates needed

3. **Commit**:
    - `[docs] Add {feature-name} PRD`

4. **Next Steps**:
    - Create abstract specification and technical design document with `/generate_spec`
    - Reference PRD requirement IDs in specification
    - If existing spec exists, recommend update

## Notes

- PRD should **NOT include technical details** (that is the role of `*_spec.md` and `*_design.md`)
- Manage requirement IDs uniquely so they can be referenced in subsequent documents
- Classify priorities using MoSCoW method (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Maintain high abstraction level and focus on "what" and "why"
