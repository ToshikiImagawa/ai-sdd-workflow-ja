# Vibe Detector - Automatic Detection of Vague Instructions

Analyzes user input to detect Vibe Coding (the problem where AI must guess undefined requirements due to vague
instructions).

## Prerequisites

**Before execution, you must read `sdd-workflow:sdd-workflow` agent content to understand AI-SDD principles.**

This skill follows the sdd-workflow agent principles for Vibe Coding detection.

### Directory Path Resolution

**Use `SDD_*` environment variables to resolve directory paths.**

| Environment Variable     | Default Value        | Description                    |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `SDD_ROOT`               | `.sdd`               | Root directory                 |
| `SDD_REQUIREMENT_PATH`   | `.sdd/requirement`   | PRD/Requirements directory     |
| `SDD_SPECIFICATION_PATH` | `.sdd/specification` | Specification/Design directory |
| `SDD_TASK_PATH`          | `.sdd/task`          | Task log directory             |

**Path Resolution Priority:**

1. Use `SDD_*` environment variables if set
2. Check `.sdd-config.json` if environment variables are not set
3. Use default values if neither exists

The following documentation uses default values, but replace with custom values if environment variables or
configuration file exists.

## Detection Patterns

### Vague Instructions

| Pattern                    | Examples                                                       |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subjective expressions** | "Make it nice," "somehow," "make it work," "make it look good" |
| **Unclear degree**         | "Make it faster," "improve a bit," "roughly working is fine"   |
| **Ambiguous scope**        | "That feature," "the previous one," "the usual"                |
| **Implicit assumptions**   | "Same as before," "as usual," "obviously..."                   |
| **Ambiguous priority**     | "If possible," "when you have time," "while you're at it"      |

### Missing Specifications

| Pattern                         | Examples                                            |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| **Missing requirements**        | "Create X feature" (no details)                     |
| **Undefined I/O**               | No arguments, return values, error cases documented |
| **Unknown boundary conditions** | Maximum/minimum values, edge cases undefined        |
| **Undefined error handling**    | Abnormal case behavior unclear                      |

### Unclear Scope

| Pattern                         | Examples                                           |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| **Vague target**                | "Improve performance" (which part? what criteria?) |
| **Unknown impact scope**        | "Refactor" (which scope?)                          |
| **Missing completion criteria** | When is it considered complete?                    |

## Risk Assessment Criteria

| Level      | Condition                        | Response                                                 |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **High**   | No specs + vague instructions    | **Require** specification creation before implementation |
| **Medium** | Specs exist + some ambiguity     | Clarify ambiguous points before implementation           |
| **Low**    | Specs exist + clear requirements | Can start implementation                                 |

## Detection Response Flow

```
1. Identify ambiguous points
   ↓
2. Determine risk level
   ↓
3. Request user confirmation/clarification
   ├─ Clarified → Proceed to implementation
   └─ Declined → Go to 4
   ↓
4. Propose specification creation/update
   ├─ Accepted → Implement after spec creation
   └─ Declined → Go to 5
   ↓
5. Explicitly warn of risks
   ↓
6. Record inferred specs in task/
   ↓
7. Implement with verification points set
```

## Output Format

Use [templates/risk_report.md](templates/risk_report.md) for risk detection output.

## Escalation When Specifications Are Insufficient

Even when user refuses specification creation, ensure minimum guardrails:

### 1. Document Inferred Specifications

Use [templates/assumed_spec.md](templates/assumed_spec.md) for creating inferred specification documents.

**Save Location**: `.sdd/task/{ticket}/assumed-spec.md`

### 2. Set Verification Points

List items to confirm with user upon implementation completion:

- Whether inferred specifications match intent
- Whether edge case behavior is as expected
- Whether non-functional requirements (performance, etc.) are met

### 3. Visualize Risks

Explicitly state potential issues due to specification gaps:

- Risk of re-implementation
- Risk of bug introduction
- Risk of technical debt accumulation

## Notes

- This skill **detects and warns** but does not block implementation
- Final judgment is left to the user
- If proceeding despite warnings, always record inferred specifications
- Reference existing project specifications to improve detection accuracy
