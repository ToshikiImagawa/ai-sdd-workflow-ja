# PRD (Product Requirements Document) Template

This document is a template for creating PRD (Product Requirements Document) under `.sdd/requirement/`.
The filename should be `{feature-name}.md`.

> **Note**: This template is a fallback for the plugin.
> When using in a project, customize it according to your project structure and
> save it as `.sdd/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Difference from Spec / Design Doc

| Document           | SDD Phase         | Role and Focus                                                                           | Abstraction           |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `requirement/*.md` | **Specify**       | **"What to build" "Why to build"** - Defines business requirements. No technical details | Highest (Abstract)    |
| `xxx_spec.md`      | **Specify**       | **"What to build"** - Defines abstract structure and behavior. No technical details      | High (Abstract)       |
| `xxx_design.md`    | **Plan (Design)** | **"How to implement"** - Concrete technical design. Ensures design decision transparency | Medium-Low (Concrete) |

# Customization Guidelines for Projects

When customizing this template for your project, update the following:

1. **Requirement ID naming convention**: Adjust to project conventions (if using prefixes other than REQ/FR/PR/IR/DC)
2. **Risk level classification**: Adjust to project's risk evaluation criteria
3. **Verification method classification**: Adjust to project's verification process
4. **Use case diagram style**: Adjust to project's actor and function structure
5. **Glossary management**: Decide whether to manage as separate file or include in PRD

**This PRD serves as the source of truth for business requirements that AI agents reference during the Specify phase.**
